	<h2 align="center" class="h2"> Story: </h2>

	<p align="center" class="p1"> You are tasked with the odyssey 
that bares no bounds, <br>
and takes you on a journey, <br>
On a journey all around. <br><br>

Make no mistake <br>
as it could be your life, <br>
The strength and the knowledge <br>
May they fall to your knife. <br> <br>

If youâ€™re cunning or quick <br>
You may just survive <br>
But take note of who you face <br>
You want to stay alive. <br><br>

Your goal is quite simple <br>
Quite simple indeed <br>
You will need to collect points <br>
100 points you will need.<br><br>


Gain points by a win<br>
Defeat them you will<br>
For it is not merely satisfaction<br>
But the rule of the thrill.<br><br>

What will be their fate? <br>
In your hands, they lie. <br>
Will you show mercy? <br>
Will you let them die?<br><br>
</p>

	<h3 align="center" class="h2"> Explanation:</h3>

	<h3  class="p1"> In the beginning, the player has a choice to roam around the map and choose his/her enemies that they want to compete against. Both players face the same enemies but will have different ways of defeating them. This is a representation on how one can defeat his/her foes by using different sets of skills, both can be equally/unequally effective depending on your choices. </h3>
	<p class="p1"> If you choose to be the character of the first warrior, you attempt to defeat your enemies with a 	dice roll, which determines the power level of your attack. The higher the number required to roll, the greater the difficulty it will be for you to defeat it. Since the character relies heavily on strength and luck, it will be more difficult to answer the riddles of knowledge based enemies.
 	</p>
	<p class="p1">
		If you choose to be the character of the second warrior, you will use your knowledge in order to defeat your enemies. Answering the riddles will become easier and you will have a greater chance of defeating them. But since the character relies heavily on intelligence, the difficulty of the strength based enemies will be greater.
	</p>

	<p class="p1"> 
		After defeating each enemy, you will be asked the moral question of whether or not they should live or die. Based on the answer you give, it will determine the score that you have earned. You will earn a score of <b>generosity</b> and <b>cruelness</b>. The higher the generosity score, the harder it will be for you to kill your enemies, but the higher the cruelness score, the easier it will be for you to defeat them.

	</p>
	<p class="p1">
		he only way to win this game is by collecting 100 points of either values. Once you have collected enough, the player is forced to fight themselves in a deceptive way in order to win. The message of the game is that no matter how much you win, by luck or by wisdom, you will ultimately become the enemy of your own defeat. 

	</p>

	<h2 class="h3">
		If you die, you will be sent to the underworld where you will be forced to pick 1 of 4 cards. One card will be the ACE card which will grant you your freedom and send you back to the start for a second chance at the game. If you do not pick correctly, you will be sent to the credits page indicating the end of the game.
